# LambdaC
LambdaC is a lightweight language built for general purpose. Tokenization and more. <http://docs.lambda.ml>

## LCCLI
LambdaC Also contains a CommandLine & App Parser for users who want to test.

It also contains a C++ API IF you would like to build more builtin classes.
# API Reference (C)
## System
System is the basic class implemented in the C++ API. It contains println, rawprint, issprint, And get().
### get(Ivar: ?VariableResolvableReference)
get Edits the "IVar"/Variable and changes it to stdin.
### println(String: StdStringResolvable)
Adds "String" to stdout.
### rawprint(String: ?StdStringResolvable)
Flushes :STRING: to Stdout without flushing the buffer.
println(hi) => hi\n
rawprint(hi) => hi
# API Reference (LC)
There are no Current libraries implemented in LambdaC.

LambdaC Doesn't have that support yet!

> *"This language is better than any of my languages ever. It contains a serialization validator, tokenizer, and extractor. I even added some Pre-Interpreter options which run before the code read has started. This was made possible thanks to the following:"*
